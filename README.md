Swift is the new Programming Language that will take over C and Objective C. It is completely different while C and Objective C can be used interchangeably. Swift is used in iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Although Objective C is was approx. 1.2 mill apps around the world (Public and private) run on (including portions of it in C) I believe learning Swift now will help us in the upcoming years and we can always look into C or C# for ideas/scenarios within existing coding and apply it in Swift.

C# (Objective C)
Pros: Used in almost all apps | Companies have apps in C# and do not plan to switch to Swift anytime soon | 30 years of support
Cons: In a few years, it may be outdated

Swift
Pros: Learning up and coming technologies | Finding opportunities with this criteria may be rarer but so will you be. | Creating applications on your own and maintaining it will not require you to worry about C or C#
Cons: Not alot of job opportunities. There isn't too much support behind the language yet.

Whichever way we go. The first thing we need to do is how the iOS API operates. The rest is learning syntax.

So.. what is an API?
Application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact and APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.

Continuing log on OneNote and updating READ ME later.

There seems to be tools within Xcode that allows you to use the GUI to develop a framework of how you want the application to look before you even start coding. Menu options that toggle features for objects you place in the Xcode viewer. I'll look into that later. 

The following are two guides on learning SWIFT.  (In downloads, upload to dropbox when I'm out of the office)- SWIFT For Dummies

Alright, now that's out of the way. The main way Developers make programs and test them out is by using a MAC machine with XCode installed. After testing it in the simulator you test it on the actual devices. Since all that costs money and resources I cannot invest at the moment, I'll look into a VM machine we can test it out on. 
It looks like VMWare or the open source alternative VirtualBox can install Mac OS X.

That's all for today. I'll have to set this up on my main laptop as the work laptop has restrictions.
